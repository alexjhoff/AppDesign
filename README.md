#I Have two other projects in process that I do not wish to be open sourced.

#Rally Up (in progress)– pairs with a pebble watch to help users find their friends in large, crowded areas with low cell reception such as a music festival

#Squad (in progress)– uses the Tesseract OCR to read a bill at a restaurant and split up the check then users can choose what they ordered and, using the Venmo API, pay their friends the exact amount of the check they owe.
