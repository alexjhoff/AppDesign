I created this project in 2014 to help combat sexual assault and generally make the experience of going out at night safer and more user centric. The main purpose of the application is to make sure that a group of friends stays together when going out and making sure that friends know a group member is still safe if they leave the group or their phone is close to dying. The application also helps users find food, get an uber home, and send coherent texts. I stopped working on this project when I found out that a similar app already existed on the app store. At the time of completion this applications worked functionally but I did not want to release it till the aesthetics were better.
